This project involves data cleaning, data manipulation, model creation and evaluation, and visualisation.
1. The data was loaded and transformed through some techniques to make it usable and to be able to be used as a train test split.
2. The best model was selected based on the prediction it made.
3. The model and the references to the columns were saved so that they could be used.
4. The visualisation that was made using the streamlit library.

I have developed it as an app so that anyone can see it without the Python IDE.
